# OpenDriverInterface

![OpenDriverInterface Logo](https://github.com/TretornESP/OpenDriverInterface/raw/main/logo.png)

OpenDriverInterface is a comprehensive framework designed for OS development hobbyists and professional kernel developers. It offers a seamless solution for integrating device drivers into your operating system through a well-documented interface and a cohesive abstraction layer. This framework is designed to be standalone, requiring minimal modifications for integration with your existing OS projects. It is versatile, catering to both those who wish to write their own device drivers and those looking to integrate a basic subset of device drivers into their OS.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration:** OpenDriverInterface provides a robust abstraction layer that simplifies the process of integrating device drivers into your operating system. This makes it a perfect choice for developers of all levels, from beginners to experts.

- **Well-Documented Interface:** We understand the importance of documentation, which is why we have provided extensive documentation for every aspect of the framework. This ensures that you have all the information you need at your fingertips to develop, modify, or troubleshoot your drivers.

- **Standalone Framework:** The framework is designed to be self-contained, meaning you can quickly integrate it into your current OS project with minimal changes. This saves time and effort while maintaining the integrity of your existing codebase.

- **Driver Implementations:** OpenDriverInterface currently includes implementations for the following device drivers:
    - AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface)
    - XHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface)
    - E1000 (Intel Gigabit Ethernet)
    - Serial Devices (UART, COM Port)
